# ECE461Project

So far in my branch I have a basic implementation of the Command Line Interface.
- Language: Typescript

Relevant Packages:
- Commander: used to implement commands in Typescript
- figlet: used to create the large, fancy title for the CLI which appears after "npm start" is called.

Instructions to set-up and run:
1. Step into the project folder in terminal/VSCode
2. run "npm run build"
  - this compiles the program and checks for bugs
3. run "npm start"
  - this starts up the CLI.
  - after this is run, you should see the CLI come up, with all the options listed.
4. Run any of the commands: "install, test, FILE_URL"
  - as of last update (9/6/23), you must call "./dist/run _____". "./run ____" will not work; this will be changed soon.
